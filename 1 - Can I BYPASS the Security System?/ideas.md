## Idea #1 - Popup Creator
The first thing I noticed is that if the site gives a popup before closure, it will not close until it gets force-closed 2-3~ more times. We could code an extension that creates a pop-up on a whitelisted site closure.

### Pros
+ Will give an extra 30 seconds of reflex time.
+ Not annoying unless it was force-closed.

### Cons
- Not permanent.

## Roadblocks

Unable to create extensions. Well there goes that idea.

## Workarounds
You could try creating a website, and adding a popup spam, since basic HTML is the only thing needed for that. Unfortunately that cannot apply to every website, and only a select few, so I guess overall this cannot work.


## Idea #2 - Internet Connection (Success!)
While trying to find loopholes in the system, I have figured out that the extension is unable to access the device if it is not connected to the internet, this is very good news for us, as I was able to see the panel for me and it said "Loading". So I would say this is a current success.

### Pros
+ Complete bypass for anything
+ Leaves no trace
+ Does what it is supposed to do
+ Google Suite (docs, slides, etc) fully works offline.


### Cons
- You will have limited site access for as long it is disconnected
- Probably other stuff but I haven't tested it yet.
- Online Multiplayer stuff does not work

## Roadblocks
It still technically is "offline" which makes it tough to find out when to disconnect.

## Workarounds
I don't know, but I will research this more.


## Idea #3 (For Search History) - Redirect Spamming
They are also able to view your search history remotely, not really a problem but I guess finding out my coding stuff can lead to finding other stuff, so why not spam redirect it?

### Pros
+ Easy to make
+ Can work really well
+ You would need to scroll... a lot


### Cons
- If you actually use search history to get back to items, well sorry.
