I have finally found a worthy reason to bypass the system. Look at this extension, that is actuvally a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) in disguise. In this journey, I will try to figure out how to bypass this.

Some very concerning things about this RAT is that it can view whatever you are doing at anytime, which is a massive invasion of privacy, I was also able to take a  at the site's "spy"board and was able to see that it can view what site you visit the most and what you are currently on. Of course, this site was most visited because I get bored and I like coding. I have a small assumption that it lags out any "other" websites because once this was noticed by me, my computer starts freezing on websites like this. COuld just be chromebook lag, or a coincidence. Apparantly GitHub might get blocked soon, which I will hopefully oppose since there is nothing malicious about the site, as it's just coding.

Let's break down what permissions this unfairly inherits:

* Read and change all your data on the websites you visit

This means it can change what the website does, nothing special since most extensions have this.

* Capture content of your screen

This is a red flag. This means it can completely read and see what you are currently doing on your computer.

* Display notifications

Not as much of a red flag.

Another thing I noticed is that if I am currently in the middle of typing something, it cannot force close the site because there is unsaved work. After about 3 close attempts it does close, but this can be a start to something.


This also seems to be linked with an extension called Relay, which has equally high threats and privacy invasions, but worse.
