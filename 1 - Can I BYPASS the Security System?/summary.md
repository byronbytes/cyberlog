I have finally found a worthy reason to bypass the system. Look at this extension, that is actually a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) in disguise. In this journey, I will try to figure out how to bypass this.

Some very concerning things about this RAT is that it can view whatever you are doing at anytime, which is a massive invasion of privacy, I was also able to take a  at the site's "spy"board and was able to see that it can view what site you visit the most and what you are currently on. Of course, this site was most visited because I get bored and I like coding. I have a small assumption that it lags out any "other" websites because once this was noticed by me, my computer starts freezing on websites like this. COuld just be chromebook lag, or a coincidence.



Another thing I noticed is that if I am currently in the middle of typing something, it cannot force close the site because there is unsaved work. After about 3 close attempts it does close, but this can be a start to something.
