# Ideas for exploits go here.



## Using Inspect Element To Paste Code Into Any Page

### What can this exploit do?

- Will lead to link exploits, site exploiting, and possible website block bypassing

### Exploit Severity

*3.5/5*

### Problems With This Exploit.

- If Inspect Element is blocked on the device (It is ðŸ˜’) then this exploit is rendered useless.





## Exploit a Flash Drive to Detect as a Peripheral

### What can this exploit do?

- Can possibly give full access if performed correctly.

### Exploit Severity

*4.5/5*

### Problems With This Exploit

- Very difficult to pull off, needs  a lot of coding and knowledge of how USB drives work, also might automatically detect as a flash drive and block it (Since for some reason using USB Drives is blockedðŸ˜•)





## Bluetooth Exploit / Network Share

### What can this exploit do?

- Access files remotely from another device and could allow an attacker to manually place code into places where it shouldn't

### Exploit Severity

*5/5*

### Problems With This Exploit

- Again, might not even entirely work, and bluetooth is most likely blocked and there are probably precautions for Network Share as well.
