# This is the folder where I compile tests and run them with output results.


## Internet Connection Test
On the client side, the user can still access stuff such as websites (if loaded before), editing documents (if offline, etc) and more. On the server side, it will appear as if the user is not online and disconnected.

## Results
This actually worked! 4.5/5 success rate.
